# How do you UI? 

The following exercise is your opportunity to show us your skills.

- Take the following brief:
-- Interpret it into a design and code it up
-- Use what you know to create the best deliverable you can
- The task is aimed at applicants across all skills and levels: 
-- Our only expectation is that you work to your ability
-- UX, Design, Code... do the bits you know
-- There is no time limit, we really want to get to know you and what you can do

## What we are looking for

How you work is your best tool, there are a few things we will be looking out for though. 

- We are particularly interested in how you approach the exercise and understanding why you chose to do things a certain way. Inline commenting is your friend for this.
- We don't just want to see the output. If you use pre-processors, build tools etc we want to see all of that because that's a skill too, so make sure it's in your submission
- It needs to be platform agnostic. If it's hooked into a particular IDE or OS or needs complicated config we aren't going to be spending time to set it up
- For design work we use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). A starter file has been provided in the *_assets* folder along with a copy of our logo

## Submitting your work

- Send us a link to your work from GitHub, Bitbucket, Dropbox ... whatever
- Please do not send attached zip files via email
- If you want to branch (named with your full name) and send us a pull request that works too
- **If there is any setup necessary please update this README.md file with a step by step guide**
- **Please gitignore any build dependencies such as /node_modules. We will get them in the build**

# The Brief

> Present useful information to visitors in the reception area of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC's main London office.

The reception area has two display screens. The first already displays a live feed from television news channels. The second should display information that our visitors will hopefully find useful and a welcome distraction for the short period they are waiting.

Information pertinent to our visitors may also be useful to our employees. They should be able to access the same from their work laptops and mobile devices.

## Display Specification
- The display is a standard flatpanel television with a resolution of 1920 x 1080
- The display is connected to a PC with internet connection
- Information will be presented through a standard web browser (assume Google Chrome)
- The front of house team will manage the PC and will be able to ensure the browser is in fullscreen mode

## Requirements
- When presented on the reception display:
-- All content must fit on-screen  
-- All content must be clear and legible from a distance
- There must be no cost for consuming the data displayed
- The company logo must be visible
- This is a publicly visible screen and must present a good image of the company
- If data is not available through loss of connection or error, the display should have a gracefull fallback mode
- The application must be able to function without any manual intervention after it's initial load

## Considerations
- We are looking for your recommendation as to the type of information to display.  What would you like to see if you were waiting in reception? 
- We are located at 8 Bouverie St, London, EC4Y 8AX
- We would prefer if updates to the display application did not require a manual refresh
- As a public face of the company we would like some certainty that updates won't be problematic, test coverage would be beneficial
