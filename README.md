# How do you UI? 

The following exercise is your opportunity to show us your skills.

- Take the following story:
-- Interpret it into a design and code it up as a static page
-- Use what you know to create the best page you can
- The task is aimed at applicants across all skills and levels. 
-- Our only expectation is that you work to your ability
-- UX, Design, Code... do the bits you know
-- There is no time limit, we really want to get to know you and what you can do

## What we are looking for

How you work is your best tool, there are a few things we will be looking out for though. 

- We are particularly interested in how you approach the exercise and understanding why you chose to do things a certain way. Inline commenting is your friend for this.
- We don't just want to see the output. If you use pre-processors, build tools etc we want to see all of that because that's a skill too, so make sure it's in your submission
- It needs to be platform agnostic. If it's hooked into a particular IDE or OS or needs complicated config we aren't going to be spending time to set it up
- For design work we use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). A starter file has been provided in the *_assets* folder along with a copy of our logo

## Submitting your work

- Send us a link to your work from GitHub, Bitbucket, Dropbox ... whatever
- Please do not send attached zip files via email
- If you want to branch (named with your full name) and send us a pull request that works too
- **If there is any setup necessary please update this README.md file with a step by step guide**
- **Please gitignore any build dependencies such as /node_modules. We will get them in the build**
